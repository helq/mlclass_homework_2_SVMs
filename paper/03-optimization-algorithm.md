# Optimization/Training Algorithm #

\inlinetodo{I'm using nu SVMs with certain parameters, to find those parameters (for
problem one and two, separately) I did a search grid}

To find the best hyperparameters for the model, i.e., gamma and degree (for
RBF and polynomial kernels, respectively), a grid search was done K-cross validation
